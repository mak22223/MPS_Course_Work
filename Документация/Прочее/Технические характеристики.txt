Ограничения, накладываемые J2534:
Для ISO 9141:
a. The maximum sink current to be supported by the interface is 100 mA.
b. The range for all tests performed relative to ISO 7637-1 is –1.0 to +40.0 V.
c. The minimum bus idle period before the interface shall transmit an address, shall be 300 ms.
d. Support following baud rate with ±0.5% tolerance: 10400.
e. Support following baud rates with ±2% tolerance: 9600, 9615, 10000, 10870, 11905, 12500, 13158,
13889, 14706, and 15625.
f. Support odd and even parity in addition to the default of no parity, with seven or eight data bits.
Always one start bit and one stop bit.

Для 14230-4 (KWP2000):
a. The interface will handle the tester present message and 0x78 response code automatically (i.e.,
without intervention from the PC).

Для CAN ISO 11898:
a. 250 and 500 kbps
b. 11 and 29 bit identifiers
c. Support for 80% ± 2% and 68.5% ± 2% bit sample point
d. Pass-thru message interface (i.e., raw CAN frames with no flow control in the pass-thru device)

Для CAN ISO 15765-4:
a. 250 and 500 kbps
b. 11 and 29 bit identifiers
c. Support for 80% ± 2% bit sample point
d. To maintain acceptable programming times, the transport layer flow control function, as defined in ISO
15765-2, must be incorporated in the pass-thru device (see Appendix A). If the application does not
use the ISO 15765-2 transport layer flow control functionality, the CAN protocol will allow for any
custom transport layer.
